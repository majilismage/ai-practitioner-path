        <div class="card-content">
            <p>Most people use AI like they use Google — they ask a question and hope for the best. But there's a massive difference between getting an answer and getting the <em>right</em> answer for <em>your</em> context.</p>
            
            <p>The problem isn't the AI. It's that we're still thinking like we're talking to a search engine instead of collaborating with an intelligent system. When you give Claude or ChatGPT a vague prompt, you get vague results. When you give it context, role clarity, and specific instructions, it becomes exponentially more useful.</p>
            
            <p>Think about it: if you hired a new team member, would you just say "make this better" and walk away? Of course not. You'd explain the context, clarify their role, specify what success looks like, and give them examples. AI works the same way.</p>

            <h3>The CRAFT Framework:</h3>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> What's the situation? What background does the AI need to give you relevant advice?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bad: "Write me an email"</li>
                <li>Good: "I need to follow up with a B2B client who went quiet after our demo call 2 weeks ago. They seemed interested but haven't responded to my last two emails."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Who should the AI be? What perspective should it take?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bad: Generic AI assistant</li>
                <li>Good: "Act as a senior sales director with 10 years of B2B experience"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Ask:</strong> What exactly do you want? Be specific about the task.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bad: "Help me with this"</li>
                <li>Good: "Draft a re-engagement email that acknowledges their silence without being pushy, references a specific point from our demo, and includes a soft call-to-action"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Format:</strong> How do you want the output structured?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bad: No guidance on structure</li>
                <li>Good: "Provide 3 subject line options, then the email body (150 words max), then 2 alternative follow-up approaches"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Tone:</strong> What's the right voice and style?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bad: Whatever the AI defaults to</li>
                <li>Good: "Professional but conversational, confident without being aggressive, with a touch of curiosity about their decision timeline"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Advanced Techniques:</h4>

            <p><strong>Chain-of-Thought:</strong> Get the AI to show its work<br>
            Instead of jumping straight to an answer, ask it to think through the problem step by step: "Before writing the email, first analyze what might have caused the silence, then consider what would motivate them to re-engage."</p>

            <p><strong>Few-Shot Examples:</strong> Show, don't just tell<br>
            Give the AI 1-2 examples of what good looks like in your context. This is especially powerful for tone and style.</p>

            <h3>Your Assignment:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Find a real document</strong> from your work: a proposal draft, client email, meeting summary, or presentation outline that you're not 100% satisfied with.</li>

                <li><strong>First attempt:</strong> Ask AI to improve it with a basic prompt like "make this better" or "rewrite this to be more professional."</li>

                <li><strong>CRAFT attempt:</strong> Use the full framework:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Context:</strong> Explain the business situation, audience, and goals</li>
                        <li><strong>Role:</strong> Ask the AI to act as a specific expert (sales director, consultant, analyst, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Ask:</strong> Be specific about what you want improved (clarity, persuasiveness, structure, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Format:</strong> Specify the output structure (sections, word count, bullet points, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Define the voice and style appropriate for your audience</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Compare side-by-side:</strong> Put both versions in a document and note the differences.</li>

                <li><strong>Chain-of-thought bonus:</strong> For the CRAFT version, start with: "Before rewriting this, first analyze what the current version does well and what could be improved, considering the audience and context."</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Example CRAFT Prompt:</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Context: I'm an account director following up on a proposal sent to a Fortune 500 procurement team 3 weeks ago. They requested detailed pricing but haven't responded since.</p>
                
                <p>Role: Act as a senior B2B sales professional with expertise in enterprise procurement cycles.</p>
                
                <p>Ask: Rewrite this follow-up email to be more engaging and likely to get a response, while addressing potential concerns about our pricing.</p>
                
                <p>Format: Subject line + email body (under 200 words) + specific next step request.</p>
                
                <p>Tone: Professional, confident, consultative, with subtle urgency but not pushy."</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">🤔 Debrief</h2>
        <div class="card-content">
            <p>After completing this exercise, reflect on these questions:</p>

            <h4>Quality:</h4>
            <p>How much better was the CRAFT version? Look at:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clarity of message</li>
                <li>Relevance to your audience</li>
                <li>Persuasiveness/impact</li>
                <li>Professional polish</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Speed:</h4>
            <p>Did the structured approach save time overall?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Less back-and-forth with the AI</li>
                <li>Fewer iterations needed</li>
                <li>More targeted feedback</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Thinking Process:</h4>
            <p>This is often the biggest shift. Notice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How did forcing yourself to define Context and Role change your understanding of the task?</li>
                <li>What did you realize about your audience that you hadn't considered before?</li>
                <li>How did specifying Format and Tone make the output more useful?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Meta-Lesson:</h4>
            <p>CRAFT isn't just about better AI outputs — it's about better thinking. When you're forced to articulate context, role, and desired outcomes, you often discover gaps in your own strategy.</p>

            <p>Most people will notice that the CRAFT version isn't just better, it's <em>faster</em> to get right. You spend 2 more minutes upfront to save 20 minutes of revision.</p>
