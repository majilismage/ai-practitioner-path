            <p>You're probably already paying for Microsoft Copilot and barely using it. Or you tried it once, got mediocre results, and wrote it off. That's because most people approach Copilot like a magic wand instead of a power tool.</p>
            
            <p>The truth: Copilot isn't trying to replace you. It's trying to eliminate the tedious parts of your job so you can focus on the strategic work. But it's only as good as your ability to direct it.</p>
            
            <p>Here's what Copilot does exceptionally well: data manipulation, first drafts, format conversions, and pattern recognition. Here's what it struggles with: nuanced judgment, complex analysis that requires domain expertise, and understanding your company's specific context.</p>
            
            <p>The key is knowing which tasks to delegate and how to structure your requests.</p>

            <h3>Your Assignment:</h3>
            <p>Choose one of these real work scenarios:</p>

            <h4>Option A: Data Analysis & Deck Creation</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Take a dataset you've been meaning to analyze (sales data, survey results, performance metrics, etc.)</li>
                <li>Upload it to Excel and use Copilot to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clean and organize the data</li>
                        <li>Create 2-3 pivot tables showing different insights</li>
                        <li>Generate charts that highlight key trends</li>
                        <li>Ask: "What are the 3 most important insights from this data?"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Use PowerPoint Copilot to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a 5-slide deck from the Excel analysis</li>
                        <li>Add presenter notes</li>
                        <li>Redesign for visual impact</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Option B: Report to Deck Conversion</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Take a recent report, proposal, or lengthy document</li>
                <li>Use Word Copilot to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create an executive summary</li>
                        <li>Extract key data points and recommendations</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Use PowerPoint Copilot to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Convert the summary into a 5-slide presentation</li>
                        <li>Generate 3 different design approaches</li>
                        <li>Create talking points for each slide</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Specific Copilot Prompts to Use:</h3>

            <h4>Excel:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Analyze this data and create visualizations that would be compelling for executives"</li>
                <li>"What questions should I be asking about this dataset?"</li>
                <li>"Create a summary table with the key metrics and trends"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>PowerPoint:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Create a presentation from this content that tells a compelling story"</li>
                <li>"Redesign these slides for maximum visual impact in a boardroom setting"</li>
                <li>"Generate presenter notes that include supporting data and potential objections"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Document Everything:</strong> Note what worked well, what needed manual intervention, and how much time it saved vs. doing it manually.</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">🤔 Debrief</h2>
        <div class="card-content">
            <p>Analyze your experience across three dimensions:</p>

            <h4>Time Savings:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>What tasks that normally take you 2+ hours did Copilot handle in minutes?</li>
                <li>Which parts of the process became faster vs. slower?</li>
                <li>Where did you spend time correcting or refining Copilot's output?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Quality Gains:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>What did Copilot create that was better than your usual first draft?</li>
                <li>What design or formatting improvements did you not think of?</li>
                <li>Which insights or patterns did it identify that you missed?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Intervention Points:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Where did you need to provide more context or direction?</li>
                <li>What outputs required significant manual editing?</li>
                <li>Which business judgments could only come from you?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Pattern:</h4>
            <p>Most people discover that Copilot is exceptional at the "heavy lifting" — data manipulation, first drafts, format conversions — but still requires human oversight for context, strategy, and final polish.</p>

            <h4>Strategic Takeaway:</h4>
            <p>The goal isn't to eliminate your involvement, it's to eliminate the tedious parts so you can focus on the parts that require judgment, creativity, and business understanding.</p>

            <h4>Next Level Question:</h4>
            <p>Based on this experience, what are 3 recurring tasks in your workweek that you could systematically delegate to Copilot?</p>
