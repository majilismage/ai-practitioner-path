            <p>Most people use AI reactively — they have a problem, they ask AI for help, they move on. But the real power comes from building proactive systems that work for you continuously.</p>
            
            <p>The difference between a tool and a system is repeatability and improvement. A tool helps you once. A system helps you every time, and gets better with use.</p>
            
            <p>Think about the recurring tasks in your work: weekly reports, client check-ins, competitive analysis, proposal reviews. Right now, you probably approach each one from scratch. But what if you had an AI system that remembered your preferences, your context, your standards, and your processes?</p>
            
            <p>That's what Claude Projects, custom instructions, and reusable prompt templates enable. You're not just using AI — you're training it to work the way you work.</p>

            <h3>Claude Projects — Your AI Workspace:</h3>

            <p>A Claude Project is like having a dedicated AI assistant for a specific area of your work. It remembers context across conversations, maintains custom instructions, and can reference uploaded documents.</p>

            <h4>When to create a Project:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>You have recurring work in a specific domain</li>
                <li>You need to reference the same documents repeatedly</li>
                <li>You want consistent output style and format</li>
                <li>You're collaborating with others who need the same context</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Example Projects:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Weekly Client Reports" (with templates, client data, and reporting standards)</li>
                <li>"Competitive Intelligence" (with competitor profiles, analysis frameworks, and update processes)</li>
                <li>"Proposal Development" (with your company info, past successful proposals, and evaluation criteria)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Custom Instructions — Your AI's Operating Manual:</h3>

            <p>Custom instructions tell your AI assistant how to behave across all interactions. Think of it as an employee handbook.</p>

            <h4>Effective custom instructions include:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Your role and industry context</li>
                <li>Your communication preferences (formal vs casual, length, structure)</li>
                <li>Your company's specific terminology and standards</li>
                <li>Common tasks and how you prefer them handled</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Example Custom Instructions:</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"I'm a senior account director in B2B SaaS, focused on enterprise clients. When I ask for help with emails, default to professional but warm tone, keep under 200 words, and always include a specific next step. When analyzing data, focus on business impact and recommendations rather than just describing trends. I prefer structured outputs with clear headers and bullet points."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>System Prompts — The Foundation:</h3>

            <p>A system prompt is like a detailed brief you give at the start of every AI conversation. It sets context, role, and expectations before you ask for specific help.</p>

            <h4>Components of a good system prompt:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Background context about your situation</li>
                <li>The AI's role and expertise level</li>
                <li>Your goals and success criteria</li>
                <li>Format and style preferences</li>
                <li>Any constraints or considerations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reusable Prompt Templates:</h3>

            <p>Instead of writing prompts from scratch each time, create templates for your recurring needs:</p>

            <h4>Weekly Report Template:</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Context: [This week's activities and focus areas]<br>
                Role: Act as my business analyst<br>
                Task: Create a structured weekly report covering [standard sections]<br>
                Format: Executive summary + detailed sections + next week priorities<br>
                Tone: Professional, data-driven, action-oriented"</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h4>Client Email Template:</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Context: [Client situation and history]<br>
                Role: Act as a senior account manager<br>
                Task: Draft a [type] email that [specific goal]<br>
                Format: Subject line + email body (under 200 words) + clear next step<br>
                Tone: [Appropriate for client relationship]"</p>

            <h3>Your Assignment:</h3>

            <h4>Step 1: Identify Your Recurring Task</h4>
            <p>Choose something you do weekly or monthly that involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Similar process each time</li>
                <li>Multiple pieces of information to analyze</li>
                <li>Consistent output format needed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Examples: Weekly client reviews, competitive analysis updates, monthly performance reports, proposal evaluations</p>

            <h4>Step 2: Create Your Claude Project</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to Claude.ai and create a new Project</li>
                <li>Name it specifically (e.g., "Q1 Enterprise Account Reviews")</li>
                <li>Upload relevant documents:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Templates you currently use</li>
                        <li>Historical reports for reference</li>
                        <li>Client data or background materials</li>
                        <li>Company standards or guidelines</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Step 3: Write Your Project Instructions</h4>
            <p>Include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your role and the project's purpose</li>
                <li>The types of tasks you'll be doing</li>
                <li>Your preferred output format and style</li>
                <li>Specific requirements or standards</li>
                <li>How you want the AI to handle different scenarios</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Example Project Instructions:</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"This project is for conducting weekly strategic account reviews. I'm a senior account director managing 15 enterprise B2B clients in the SaaS space.</p>
                
                <p>When I upload client data or ask for analysis, provide:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Executive summary (2-3 sentences)</li>
                    <li>Key metrics and trends (with context)</li>
                    <li>Risk assessment (high/medium/low with reasoning)</li>
                    <li>Recommended actions (specific, time-bound)</li>
                    <li>Questions to investigate further</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Format as structured markdown with clear headers. Be data-driven but include strategic implications. Flag urgent issues at the top."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h4>Step 4: Test with Real Data</h4>
            <p>Upload a real dataset or information and ask your AI assistant to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyze it according to your project instructions</li>
                <li>Generate your standard deliverable format</li>
                <li>Identify patterns or insights you might have missed</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Step 5: Refine and Iterate</h4>
            <p>Based on the output:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adjust your project instructions</li>
                <li>Add more specific examples</li>
                <li>Upload additional reference materials</li>
                <li>Create follow-up prompt templates</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="card-content">
            <p>Look at what you've built and think about it as a scalable system:</p>

            <h4>Documentation Gaps:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>What context did you assume the AI would know?</li>
                <li>What steps in your process did you skip because they're "obvious" to you?</li>
                <li>What quality checks or validation steps should be built in?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Standard Operating Procedure Elements:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear triggers for when to use this system</li>
                <li>Step-by-step process from input to final deliverable</li>
                <li>Quality standards and what good output looks like</li>
                <li>Error handling (what to do when AI output isn't quite right)</li>
                <li>Escalation criteria (when human judgment is required)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Scalability Considerations:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Could someone else in your company use this system?</li>
                <li>What company-specific context would they need?</li>
                <li>How would you train them to refine and improve the prompts?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Bigger Picture:</h4>
            <p>You've just built your first AI workflow. The principles you learned here — clear instructions, structured processes, iterative improvement — are the foundation for everything we'll build in later missions.</p>

            <p>Most importantly, you've shifted from <em>using</em> AI to <em>directing</em> AI. That's the difference between a tool and a system.</p>
