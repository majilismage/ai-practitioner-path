        <div class="card-content">
            <p>The biggest mistake professionals make with AI isn't technical — it's strategic. They either expect too much (AI can't read minds or understand unspoken context) or too little (AI can actually handle complex reasoning and creative tasks).</p>
            
            <p>This isn't about memorizing model specifications. It's about developing intuition for where AI adds value vs. where human expertise is irreplaceable. When you understand these boundaries, you can design workflows that amplify your strengths instead of fighting AI's limitations.</p>
            
            <p>The goal is to build a mental map: Given this type of task, in this context, with this level of risk, should you use AI, avoid it, or use it in a specific way?</p>

                <li>Anything where being wrong creates significant liability</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Strategic Framework:</h3>

            <h3>Your Assignment:</h3>

            <h4>Step 1: Audit Your Current AI Use</h4>
            <p>For the next week, track every time you use AI (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, etc.):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What was the task?</li>
                <li>How satisfied were you with the result? (1-5 scale)</li>
                <li>How much did you need to edit or refine the output?</li>
                <li>Would you use AI for this task again?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Step 2: Identify Missed Opportunities</h4>
            <p>Look at your typical work week and identify 3-5 tasks that you currently do manually that might be good AI candidates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are they repetitive or systematic?</li>
                <li>Do they involve pattern recognition or content transformation?</li>
                <li>Would mistakes be easy to catch?</li>
                <li>Can you provide clear instructions and context?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Step 3: Run Capability Tests</h4>
            <p>Pick 2-3 tasks from your "missed opportunities" list and test them with AI:</p>

            <h5>Test Structure:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Define the task clearly</li>
                <li>Provide context and examples</li>
                <li>Specify your quality criteria</li>
                <li>Run the test with your preferred AI model</li>
                <li>Evaluate the output against your criteria</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Example Test:</h5>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>Task:</strong> "Review this vendor proposal and identify potential risks"<br>
                <strong>Context:</strong> "We're considering this software vendor for a 3-year contract. Focus on technical, financial, and operational risks."<br>
                <strong>Quality Criteria:</strong> "Should identify at least 3 specific risks with severity assessment and mitigation suggestions."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h4>Step 4: Map Your Personal AI Strategy</h4>
            <p>Based on your tests and audit, create three lists:</p>

            <h5>Green Light (High Confidence):</h5>
            <p>Tasks where AI consistently delivers good results with minimal editing</p>

            <h5>Yellow Light (Collaboration):</h5>
            <p>Tasks where AI provides a useful starting point but requires significant human input</p>

            <h5>Red Light (Human Only):</h5>
            <p>Tasks where AI either fails or where the risk of mistakes is too high</p>

            <p><strong>Document your findings in a simple matrix:</strong></p>
            <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-top: 1rem;">
                <tr style="background: var(--bg-tertiary);">
                    <th style="padding: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid var(--border);">Task Type</th>
                    <th style="padding: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid var(--border);">AI Role</th>
                    <th style="padding: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid var(--border);">Human Role</th>
                    <th style="padding: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid var(--border);">When to Use</th>
                    <th style="padding: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid var(--border);">When to Avoid</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="padding: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid var(--border);">Example...</td>
                    <td style="padding: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid var(--border);"></td>
                    <td style="padding: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid var(--border);"></td>
                    <td style="padding: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid var(--border);"></td>
                    <td style="padding: 0.5rem; border: 1px solid var(--border);"></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
    </div>

        <h2 class="card-title">🤔 Debrief</h2>
        <div class="card-content">
            <h4>Pattern Recognition:</h4>
            <p>Looking at your results, what patterns do you notice?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which types of tasks consistently worked well with AI?</li>
                <li>Where did AI struggle in ways you didn't expect?</li>
                <li>What surprised you about AI's capabilities (positively or negatively)?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Strategic Insights:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>How much time could you realistically save by systematically using AI for your "Green Light" tasks?</li>
                <li>What would you do with that time if AI handled more routine work?</li>
                <li>Which "Yellow Light" tasks could become "Green Light" with better prompting or different AI models?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Boundary Awareness:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Where did you discover important limitations you hadn't considered?</li>
                <li>What tasks did you initially think were AI-suitable but turned out not to be?</li>
                <li>How has this changed your mental model of where AI fits in your work?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Meta-Learning:</h4>
            <p>The goal isn't to maximize AI usage — it's to optimize the human-AI combination. The best AI practitioners aren't those who use AI for everything, but those who know exactly when and how to use it for maximum impact.</p>

            <h4>Next Level Questions:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>How could you systematize your "Green Light" tasks to save even more time?</li>
                <li>What would change if AI capabilities improved significantly in the next 6 months?</li>
                <li>How do you stay updated on AI capability improvements without getting distracted by hype?</li>
            </ul>
