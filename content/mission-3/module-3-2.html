        <div class="card-content">
            <p>The next frontier of AI productivity isn't a single, super-intelligent assistant — it's teams of specialized AI agents working together on complex tasks, each optimized for specific roles and responsibilities.</p>
            
            <p>Think about how the best human teams work: you don't have one person do everything. You have specialists (researcher, analyst, writer, reviewer) who hand off work to each other, building on each other's strengths. AI teams can work the same way.</p>
            
            <p>Multi-agent workflows transform complex projects from overwhelming single-session struggles into orchestrated collaborations where each AI agent focuses on what it does best.</p>

            <h3>Multi-Agent Architecture:</h3>

            <h4>Specialist Roles:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Research Agent:</strong> Information gathering, source verification, trend analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Analysis Agent:</strong> Data processing, pattern identification, insight generation</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy Agent:</strong> High-level planning, decision frameworks, option evaluation</li>
                <li><strong>Creation Agent:</strong> Content generation, design concepts, solution development</li>
                <li><strong>Review Agent:</strong> Quality assurance, error checking, improvement suggestions</li>
                <li><strong>Synthesis Agent:</strong> Integration of multiple inputs, final recommendations</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Workflow Patterns:</h4>

            <h5>Sequential Pipeline:</h5>
            <p>Research → Analysis → Strategy → Creation → Review</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each agent completes their task before passing to the next</li>
                <li>Clear handoffs with specific deliverables</li>
                <li>Good for linear, document-based projects</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Parallel Processing:</h5>
            <p>Research Agent + Market Analysis Agent + Technical Assessment Agent → Synthesis Agent</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects</li>
                <li>Final integration of parallel outputs</li>
                <li>Faster completion for complex analysis</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Iterative Collaboration:</h5>
            <p>Strategy Agent ↔ Analysis Agent ↔ Review Agent (multiple rounds)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Agents refine each other's work through multiple cycles</li>
                <li>Continuous improvement and error correction</li>
                <li>Best for high-stakes or creative projects</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Agent Specialization Techniques:</h3>

            <h4>Role Definition:</h4>

            </blockquote>

            <h4>Process Specialization:</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Your role in this workflow is to: 1) Gather comprehensive market data from multiple sources, 2) Verify information credibility and recency, 3) Identify key trends and patterns, 4) Summarize findings in a structured format for the strategy team, 5) Flag any data gaps or uncertainties."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h4>Output Format Specification:</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Always structure your output as: Executive Summary (3 bullet points), Key Findings (numbered list with source citations), Market Trends (3-5 trends with supporting data), Uncertainties (what you couldn't verify), Recommendations for further research."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Your Assignment:</h3>

            <h4>Design a Multi-Agent Workflow:</h4>
            <p>Choose a complex project that normally takes you 2-3 weeks to complete. This should be something that involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Research and data gathering</li>
                <li>Analysis and insight generation</li>
                <li>Strategic thinking and planning</li>
                <li>Content or solution creation</li>
                <li>Review and refinement</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Step 1: Workflow Design</h4>

            <h5>Break Down the Project:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>List all major tasks</strong> in your typical approach</li>
                <li><strong>Group related tasks</strong> that could be handled by a single specialist</li>
                <li><strong>Identify dependencies</strong> — what must be completed before other tasks can start</li>
                <li><strong>Define handoff points</strong> — where one specialist's work becomes input for another</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Design Agent Roles:</h5>
            <p>For each group of tasks, create a specialized agent with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Role Definition:</strong> Professional background and expertise area</li>
                <li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Specific tasks this agent will handle</li>
                <li><strong>Inputs Required:</strong> What this agent needs to start work</li>
                <li><strong>Output Format:</strong> How this agent should deliver results</li>
                <li><strong>Quality Standards:</strong> Criteria for successful completion</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Step 2: Create Agent Prompts</h4>
            <p>For each agent in your workflow, develop detailed prompt templates:</p>

            <h5>Agent Setup Prompt:</h5>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"You are a [specific role] with [relevant experience]. Your expertise includes [key skills]. In this workflow, you are responsible for [specific tasks]. 

                Your working style is [methodology]. You always [quality standards]. Your outputs should be [format requirements].

                Context for this project: [background information]
                Success criteria: [how to measure good work]"</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h5>Task Execution Prompt:</h5>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Based on the handoff from [previous agent]: [specific inputs]

                Your task is to: [detailed requirements]

                Please structure your output as: [format specification]

                Before completing, verify that you have: [quality checklist]"</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h4>Step 3: Execute Sequential Workflow</h4>
            <p>Run your multi-agent workflow from start to finish:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Agent 1:</strong> Execute first phase with detailed prompt</li>
                <li><strong>Human Review:</strong> Check output quality and prepare handoff</li>
                <li><strong>Agent 2:</strong> Execute second phase using Agent 1's output</li>
                <li><strong>Continue...</strong> Until workflow completion</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Step 4: Document and Optimize</h4>

            <h5>Track Performance:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Time spent on each agent interaction</li>
                <li>Quality of outputs (rate 1-5)</li>
                <li>Handoff issues or missing information</li>
                <li>Where human intervention was required</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Compare to Single-Agent Approach:</h5>
            <p>Complete the same project using one generalist AI agent and compare:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Total time invested</li>
                <li>Quality and depth of final output</li>
                <li>Which approach felt more manageable</li>
                <li>Where each approach had advantages</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Step 5: Workflow Refinement</h4>
            <p>Based on your experience, optimize the workflow:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eliminate bottlenecks:</strong> Where did agents need more information or clearer instructions?</li>
                <li><strong>Improve handoffs:</strong> What additional context would make transitions smoother?</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance specialization:</strong> Where could agents be more focused or expert?</li>
                <li><strong>Add quality gates:</strong> Where do you need human review checkpoints?</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Create a Reusable Template:</h5>
            <p>Document your optimized workflow as a template for similar projects in the future.</p>
