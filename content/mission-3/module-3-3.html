        <div class="card-content">
            <p>The future of work isn't humans versus AI or AI replacing humans — it's humans and AI working together in ways that amplify both human creativity and AI capabilities.</p>
            
            <p>But effective human-AI collaboration doesn't happen automatically. It requires understanding where each partner excels, designing intentional interaction patterns, and developing new professional skills for working with AI systems.</p>
            
            <p>The most successful AI practitioners don't just use AI as a tool — they develop genuine partnerships where human judgment guides AI capabilities toward outcomes neither could achieve alone.</p>
